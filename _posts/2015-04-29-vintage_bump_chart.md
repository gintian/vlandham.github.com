A quick shoutout for another vintage visualization I implemented in code:

<div class="center">
<a href="http://vallandingham.me/census_bump/"><img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/vis/census_bump.png" alt="census bump" style=""/></a>
</div>

The entire thing was implementing using JavaScript and D3.js. It's about 700 lines of code with 200 lines of data and configuration.

Learn more about this classic visualization, and the code that was used to build it, in my [Bocoup blog post](http://bocoup.com/weblog/vintage-visualization-restoration-bump-chart/).
