I was very fortunate to be able to speak at the first [OpenVis Conf](http://openvisconf.com/) in Boston in April 2013.

The speakers were wonderful. The [organizers](http://bocoup.com/) were graceful. The venue was delightful.

## Video

The talk was recorded, and can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mucmb33711A):

or [the archived OpenVis 2013 Site](https://openvisconf.com/2013/).

## Slides

[Here are my slides for Abusing the Force](http://vallandingham.me/force_talk/#0)

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate. Each slide is its own html page. The [source is all on github](https://github.com/vlandham/force_talk)

I also put the slides on speaker deck for easy viewing:

</script>

It was a great time, and again, I feel very honored and humbled to have been part of OpenVis Conf.
