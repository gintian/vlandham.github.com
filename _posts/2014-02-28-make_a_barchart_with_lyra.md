**WARNING:** Lyra is labelled as _alpha_. Its interface might have changed since this posting.

A few days ago [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://twitter.com/arvindsatya1) from the [UW Interactive Data Lab](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/) released an alpha version of [Lyra](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/projects/lyra/) that promises to be a way to create complex data visualizations without code. Think of it like an open source Adobe Illustrator, for data visualizations. Sounds pretty awesome, right? But does it work?!

Let’s find out.

There are a number of very interesting examples to learn from on the Lyra main page. These examples recreate some well known complex visuals.

I wanted to see what would be required to create a really basic bar chart - as a way to start to learn more about this interesting tool.

Here’s the final product:

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_final.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
Pretty simple right? But [sometimes simple ways are best](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/) . So follow along with me for a bit of Lyra fun!

## Your Visualization Development Environment

Here’s what it looks like when you first [open Lyra](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/projects/lyra/app/) :

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_01_small.png" alt="" style="border:0px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
I’ve annotated the app with my own terminology to provide a bit of orientation.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_01_2_small.png" alt="" style="border:0px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
The far **left panel** provides capabilities to add data to the visualization and manipulate this data.

The **top bar** allows you to drag new visual components or [marks](https://github.com/trifacta/vega/wiki/Tutorial#wiki-marks) into the visualization.

These marks are organized into layers (just like Illustrator!). Properties of the marks in a visualization can be manipulated in the far **right panel**. This panel is also used to modify the size of the visual, its axes, etc.

The **middle** gives you a preview of the visualization. You can also move around and resize the layers of your work here.

We will start with the data input and manipulation panel first. Far left.

## A Simple Data Pipeline

Let’s pull in some data. Adding and manipulating data in Lyra is called a **Data Pipeline**. To avoid complications, I used _medals_, one of the sample data sets provided by Lyra. This set gives data about who won what at the Olympics (I’m guessing it is the 2014 Winter Olympics, but I don’t really know. I don’t really know much Olympics).

Click on the _From Source_ drop down and select _medals_.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_02_1.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
The original data includes gold, silver, and bronze medal winnings. Let’s just go for gold!

### Filter Transform

To get this done inside Lyra, we can use the **Transforms** feature to modify the input data.

Click on the _New Transform_ button.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_03_1.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
Then click on the *Filter* button

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_04_1.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
We get a little Filter input field. We are going to perform our first data binding in Lyra now. This involves dragging column names from the Data section to a little circle *data binding* visual.

In this instance we are going to drag the column `Medal_Type` over to the Filter section.

Here is a little animated gif of the whole process:

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/bind.gif" alt="" style="border:0px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
I’ll break it down step-by-step for the anti-gif folks out there. Here’s the `Medal_Type` move.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_06_1.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
Once you do that, `Medal_Type` should show up in your filter input.

Now we are going to complete the filter by checking this column against the string _“Gold”_.

This appears to be JavaScript, so you are going to want to use the double equals: `Medal_Type == "Gold"`. In fact, a single equals sign in that filter seems to modify your data on the fly… which could be useful in other circumstances.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_07.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
Once you have the filter setup, click *Add to Pipeline*. This will add the filter step to your pipeline (as you might guess by the name of the button).

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_08.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
If you look at the values shown in the Data panel, you should see that only those with `Medal_Type` as *Gold* are shown. Pretty cool right?

### Sort those Medals

Now I want to sort the data in order of medal counts, so the countries with the most medals appear at the top. You might have guessed it by now, but we are going to use the sort Transform.

Click on the _New Transform_ button again, but this time select _Sort_.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_04_2.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
Now we need to pull `Count` down to the *Sort By* field:

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_09_1.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
Then select *Descending* for the *Order*. Once you add this to the pipeline, we should have all our data transformations done, and be ready for some visualizing.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_10.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>

## The Visualization

Now let’s move our attention over to the far right panel.

We see _Visualization_ at the top, and _Layer 1_ which is clickable to show more options.

### Give Yourself Some Room

One thing that took me a while to find was how to change the width and height of the entire visualization. The width and height of a layer (even the first layer) isn’t the same as the width and height of the entire visual.

To change the visualizations size, click on the _Visualization_ header. You should see _Dimensions_ and _Padding_ options.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_11_1.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
As you can see in the image above, I gave my visualization some space by changing the *Width* to `700` and *Height* to `500`. I am assuming this is in pixels. For now, let’s leave the *Padding* setting alone.

### Your First Mark

Now is the moment we’ve all been waiting for: the start of the actual visualization.

Visual elements, like rectangles, lines, and even text are known as **marks**. We are going to add a rectangle mark for our bar chart.

To do this, drag the _rectangle_ mark from Marks Menu on top down to the visualization preview section:

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_12_1.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
And release. You’ll be left with a little blue rectangle in your visualization preview.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_13.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
Animated gif version:

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/rect.gif" alt="" style="border:0px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>

The visualization panel should reflect this addition as well. You should see a _Rect 1_ mark under _Layer 1_. This is where we are going to associate data elements with the attributes of the rectangle.

### Binding the Data

Ok, so far this just looks like a drawing app. That square is nice and all, but isn’t what you would call a “data visualization”. Let’s really start making the vis happen by binding some data to the visual properties of the rectangle mark.

The process is similar to how we used data elements in our data transforms. It works by drag-and-drop.

Because we are making a vertical bar chart, I want to associate the width of one or more rectangles with the count of Olympic medals for a country. You should see _Width_ listed as a property of _Rect 1_.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_15_1.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>

Right now it is set to a constant number. We are going to drag over the `Count` data element from our data pipeline and connect it to the little circle visual next to _Width_. You really have to drop it right on the circle to make it count.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_16_1_small.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>

Once you release the data element, you should see your visualization preview change to show a bunch of rectangles on top of one another - instead of what looked like just one.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_17.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>

Not a bad start, but a bit crowded. Let’s move them off one another. I think you could do this a number of ways, but try binding the `Country_Code` data element to the mark’s _Y Position_ property. Since the country code is unique for each bar (as we have already filtered to only include gold medals), this make each bar move to a unique position. Try it. Drag the `Country_Code` data element to _Y Position_ and release.

My Lyra looks something like this:

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_18_small.png" alt="" style="border:0px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>

We can start to see a little bar chart starting to form. Exciting!

### Getting the Look

Now that we have bars, let’s make them a bit more attractive. First, modify the _Height_ property to be `15` - so they aren’t sitting on top of one another.

Also, set the _X Position_ to `0`. We will move it around in a second.

Now we can gild our blue bars. Modify the _Fill color_ property. You can type in a specific hex or other [css color name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value). Feel free to pick one less terrible than mine. `#e68b02` was as gold as I wanted to get.

Now I’m going to make room for my title and bar annotations by moving the layer over a bit. You could do this in the right panel by clicking on _Layer 1_ and setting the x/y position as well as the width and height. But, you can also do this in a more visual manner by moving the layer around in the Visualization Preview panel.

If you move your mouse inside the Visualization Preview, you should see the layer parameter highlighted with a little dotted line. Click inside that dotted line (but not on a bar) to select _Layer 1_. The little rectangles around the parameter should indicate it is selected.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_19.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
Now click on these parameter rectangles and resize each side of the layer until its in the location you want. This will take some jostling - and can always be modified in the future.

You can check the settings in the _Layer 1_ properties. I ended up with the following:

- _X Start_ : `105`
- _Width_ : `580`
- _Y Start_ : `50`
- _Height_ : `400`

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_20_small.png" alt="" style="border:0px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
I don’t know if the visual manipulation is easier or more work than just trying out different values in the input boxes, but its nice to have options.

Again, the general idea is that I know I want to make room for a title and some labels on the side.

### Label Those Bars

Ok, we make room for them, now let’s add some labels. As you might suspect, we are going to use the _Text_ mark. Drag one of them down to your visualization preview - just like we did with the rectangle.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_21_1.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
You should see a little blue text that reads “text”. Cute, but useless.

To get the country names on the screen, bind the `Country_Name` data element to the _Text_ property of the text mark. This is the same drag-and-drop as before.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_22_1_small.png" alt="" style="border:0px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
Now you have a big jumble of little blue text.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_23.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
Bind the *Y Position* property to `Country_Code`, like you did for the rectangles. For some reason, I was having some problems with this drag-and-drop. Make sure the right circle changes color before you let go with your mouse.

Now the labels are starting to look like labels. To clean them up a bit, I set their _Align Horizontal_ to `Right Align`.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_24.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
Next, I played around with the x/y position and offset. I ended up with a `-7` *X Position* and a `10` *Y Offset*. Also, I changed the color to `#777777`. Ta Da!

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_25_small.png" alt="" style="border:0px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>

### Always Add an Axis

Things are coming along now!

But we need to give our visual some perspective. What numbers are these bars actually representing? 50? 500? Let’s add an axis to find out.

In Lyra, it looks like Axes are associated with a particular layer. If you scroll back to the top of the right panel, you should see a little _Axes_ section with a plus button to add a new axis. Click that button now.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_26_1.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
You should see a little new axis panel appear:

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_27.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
For *Type* we are going to use `X`. For orient, we are going to use `bottom`. Now we need to associate a Scale with the axis. In the bottom left-hand corner of the screen, you should see your *Scales* menu. Drag up your *X Scale* and drop it in the Axis *Scale* property.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_28_1_small.png" alt="" style="border:0px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
Once its dropped in, you should see your scale appear at the bottom of the preview panel. Pretty slick!

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/scale.gif" alt="" style="border:0px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
I changed all the colors of each element of the axis to `#777777`. I did try messing with the other properties of the axis mark and ended up screwing everything up. This will probably not be an issue in the future - but be advised - right now it seems a little picky.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_29.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>

### Finish with a Title

Ok, my fingers are cramping up. We need to end this tutorial quick, so let’s add a title.

To do this, drop another Text mark into your visualization preview. Instead of associating its text with a data element, we will just type out a title. I choose “Gold Medals by Country”. You can use that too, if you want. A better title would be “Olympic Gold Medals by Country”. An even better title would include a date.

Next position and style. This should all be familiar, as we just did it with the labels. To mix things up a bit, I switched the _Font Family_ to `Georgia`, and set the color to `#595959`. _Font Size_ is 24.

Right now this text mark is part of the same layer as everything else. This might be the wrong way to do things - but it works at least in this simple example. A consequence of this association is that the _Y Position_ will need to be negative to move the title above the chart. I set the _Y Position_ as `-24` and the _X Position_ as `130` to get my particular styling. You can do better.

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_30_small.png" alt="" style="border:0px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>

### Save and Share!

Down at the bottom of the screen are a few utility buttons:

<div class="center">
<img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/lyra/lyra_31.png" alt="" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/>

</div>
You can export your work of art as SVG or PNG for static showing. You can also export as a [Vega spec](http://trifacta.github.io/vega/) to allow for more interactive end goals. I haven’t done much with Vega yet, but this is a particularly exciting possibility that will require future exploring.

You should also be able to save the Lyra settings in your browser history and load up old ones from this button bar.

### Your Homework

Hopefully you enjoyed this little introduction to Lyra. I think it might turn out to be a very useful tool in the future for creating data visualizations in a systematic, but non-programmatic way.

If you want to build on this example, what about filtering out countries with 0 gold medals?

Right now India, Armenia, etc are shown, but their bar values are really 0. Try filtering out these countries and re-situating the visual elements to take up this extra space.

For the more adventurous, try getting a visual display for all 3 types of medals. This might involve using the _Group By_ Transform to add some hierarchy to the data.

And that is a simple introduction to Lyra. Hopefully starting with the basics will encourage us all to start making more advanced graphics with these tools and allow us to better understand the more complex starting points created by the author.

My first thoughts on Lyra is that it is certainly rough around the edges, but could provide real value to the visualization community.

It has some overlap with Design Density’s wonderful [RAW](http://app.raw.densitydesign.org/#/) app. While RAW is more polished, I think Lyra might ultimately provide a more powerful feature set for those interested in learning the tool.

Lyra’s binding capabilities allow for comparisons to some of what is featured in Bret Victor’s [Drawing Dynamic Visualizations](http://worrydream.com/#!/DrawingDynamicVisualizationsTalk) tool. If his tool is released, it will be interesting to compare further.

D3’s success in the data visualization world has been in part because of its [large thriving community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/d3-js) . And this large community was built up quickly in part because of the many [examples](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery) provided by the authors as well as other individuals.

Let’s hope Lyra, if it proves useful to others, is also able to foster an active community - capable of taking it to the next level.
